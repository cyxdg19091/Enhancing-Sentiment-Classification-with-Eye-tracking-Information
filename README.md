## Enhancing Sentiment Classification with Eye-tracking Information
When reading, humans do not give equal attention to each word in the text. Instead, they tend to concentrate on less predictable content words while ignoring function words and predictable ones.

Since eye-trackers have become more affordable and accessible in recent decades, data on human reading eye movements has become increasingly comprehensive, and is commonly used to develop NLP models. NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, relation classification, and entity recognition
have benefited from this approach. In this project, I compare the performance of the model with eyetracking data attached to the sentiment analysis task with the baseline, hoping to see whether using such a human feature can improve the classification task.
